# SOC-Simulator with ELK

This is an intensive program to help aspiring SOC analysts gain real-world practical experience in just 30 days. It was designed by [Steven Maeh](https://www.mydfir.com/), a very well-known DFIR consultant with long experience working and focusing within the security operations domain.

After I completed the challenge, I gained confidence and solid skills related to an SOC environment. I also acquired a methodology for detecting and investigating alerts using a SIEM and a ticketing system.

## 🚀 Achievements in this project


---

### 🛡️ Security Operations & Threat Detection
- ✅ Completed a **30-day structured SOC analyst challenge**, simulating real-world security operations tasks including **threat detection**, investigation, and **incident reporting**.
- 🔍 Simulated **brute-force attacks** and **malware activity** against cloud-hosted infrastructure to understand attacker behavior and detection methods.

---

### 🖥️ ELK Stack & Log Management
- 📊 Deployed and configured the full **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** in a cloud environment for centralized log collection and **real-time analysis**.
- 📝 Ingested logs from endpoint sources using **Winlogbeat** and **Sysmon**, gaining hands-on experience parsing Windows event logs for **security-relevant activity**.

---

### ⚡ Detection, Dashboards & Automation
- 📈 Created **detection rules** and **visual dashboards** in Kibana, enabling proactive threat monitoring and trend analysis.
- 🎫 Built and integrated an **osTicket ticketing system** to track incident investigations and reinforce real-world SOC workflow practices.

---

### 🕵️ Threat Hunting & Incident Response
- 🐍 Performed hands-on investigations of **command-and-control (C2) activity** using the **Mythic C2 framework**, enhancing threat hunting capabilities.
- 🔄 Demonstrated end-to-end **incident handling skills**—from log ingestion to detection, investigation, and case management—using open-source and enterprise-style tooling.
